1. set the following environment paths:

	PATH = <absolute path to command line tools>;  <absolute path to GNU command line tools>
	MWCIncludes = <absolute path to GCC library headers as well as the MW PS2 Support folder>
	MWLibraries = <absolute path the GCC library directories>
	MWLibraryFiles = <semicolon seperated list of all libraries to be used>

2. Drop the license file into the same directory as the command line tools.

3. Use the CW provided custom LCF in the PS2 Support folder.  Drop into same directory as
   the source files and pass to linker in your makefile.

4. You'll need the gcc_wrapper.c for some of the projects.  Drop this into the same
   directory of your source files. Or modify the MAKEFILE with a new rule to explicity
   point to it.

5. MAKEFILE modifications:
   - comment out the SHELL rule.
   - change the names of the compiler, linker to the CW compiler and linker.
   - remove the gcc compiler flags that are incompatible (eg, -Wall, -Werror, -fno-common)
   - remove the gcc linker flags that are incompatible (eg, -T, -Wl, -nostartfiles, arguments
     passed to the -map option, "," )
   - pass the prefix file to the CW compiler using the -prefix <name of file> option
   - Replace the unix command 'rm' with 'del' in the rule for 'make clean'
   - define the entrypoint for the final executable by passing -m ENTRYPOINT as an option
     to the linker.

6. Windows95 anomolies (ie, not NT) to be aware of:
   - the 'rm' MAKEFILE rule is problematic.  Replace 'del' with 'command.com /c del'.  Or
     just don't use 'make clean'.  The 'del' command doesn't seem to like multile arguments,
     so '$(RM) *.o *.map' will not work. (I believe Steven has a work around to get this to work).
   - make sure windows source files are of the same case as what's written in the makefile.
   - ' > $*.lst ' to create a listing file is problematic.  Remove this.
