 *
 *	THEORY OF OPERATION
 *
 *	The Exception Table for a function contains a target-specific variable-length structure
 *	that includes all information necessary to unwind the stack frame for the function.
 *	A MIPS stack frame looks like this:
 *
 *	HIGH ADDRESSES	|						|
 *					|						|
 *					|-----------------------|
 *					|	incoming arguments	|
 *					|						|
 *	Caller's SP   =>|-----------------------|
 *					|	GPR save area		|	Storage for nonvolatile GPRs used by callee
 *					|-----------------------|
 *					|	FPR save area		|	Storage for nonvolatile FPRs used by callee
 *					|-----------------------|
 *					|		Callee's		|
 *					|	local variables		|
 *					|-----------------------|
 *					|	outgoing arguments	|
 *					|						|
 *	Callee's SP   =>|-----------------------|
 *					|						|
 *	LOW ADDRESSES	|						|
 *
 *	In order to unwind the stack frame, then, we need the following information:
 *
 *	(1)	Frame Size		Since there's no back-link in the frame, we need this to
 *						pop to the caller's frame.
 *
 *	(2)	Argument Size	When we transfer control to a catch-block, the thrower's frame
 *						is still on the stack (because the exception temporary was
 *						allocated there) and if the thrower's argument area is smaller
 *						than the catcher's then we need to increase it before jumping
 *						to the catch-block.
 *
 *	(3)	# Saved GPRs	We need this to restore any of the nonvolatile registers (r16-r23,r30)
 *						that were saved in the frame.
 *
 *	(4)	# Saved FPRs	We need this to restore any of the nonvolatile registers (f20-r31)
 *						that were saved in the frame.
 *
 *	(5)	Separate FP?	We need to know if the frame uses a separate frame pointer (r30)
 *						for accessing locals etc; this will be true for any function
 *						which calls alloca() or which contains a catch-block.
 *
 *	We represent the Unwind Info using a variable-length structure:
 *
 *	|<-2 bits->|<-1 bit->|<-1 bit->|<-4 bits->|
 *	+----------+---------+---------+----------+
 *	|  unused  | has FP? | unused  |  # GPRs  |
 *	+----------+---------+---------+----------+
 *	|  unused  | unused  | unused  |  # FPRs  |
 *	+----------+---------+---------+----------+
 *	| Frame Size (1/2/3/4 bytes as needed)	  |
 *	+-----------------------------------------+
 *	| Argument Size (1/2/3/4 bytes as needed) |
 *	+-----------------------------------------+
 *
 *	The Frame Size and Outgoing Argument Area Size are represented using the variable-length
 *	unsigned integer format. For most functions, these will occupy only 1 byte each, so the
 *	entire Unwind Info for a function will typically occupy 3 bytes.
