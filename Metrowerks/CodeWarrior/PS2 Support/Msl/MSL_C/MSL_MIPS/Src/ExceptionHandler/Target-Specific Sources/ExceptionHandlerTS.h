 *
 *	We don't actually modify the runtime stack; we simply restore the values of
 *	all registers saved in the current function to their value in the function's
 *	caller, IN THE LOCAL COPY OF THE REGISTER VALUES STORED IN 'context'. When we
 *	finally transfer control to a catch-block, we'll copy these values into the
 *	actual machine registers.
 *
 *	We return the return address in the caller--the place where the function whose
 *	frame we are popping would have returned to--so that the caller can use it to
 *	find the corresponding exception table.
 *
 *	We cannot correctly set 'context->FP' to the new frame's frame pointer because
 *	we don't yet have the exception table, which tells us whether the frame used
 *	a separate frame pointer or whether 'context->FP' == 'context->SP'.

 *	address local variables in the current frame. This information is only used
 *	by __LocalVariable() defined below.
 *
 *	Typically this involves setting 'context->FP' to 'context->SP' for functions
 *	which do not have a separate frame pointer, or to whichever general-purpose
 *	register is used as a frame pointer for functions which do require a separate
 *	frame pointer.
 *
 *	On most RISC machines, locals can be addressed via SP unless the function
 *	calls alloca() or contains a catch-block or exception-specification, in which
 *	case a separate frame pointer is used because SP may float while the function
 *	is executing.
 *
 *	It is convenient to retain the decoded UnwindInfo in the target-specific portion
 *	of the ThrowContext so it can be reused by __PopStackFrame() and other routines.

 *
 *	If there is any target-specific ExceptionInfo it must be initialized here
 *	as well, e.g. base address of code/data sections.
 *
 *	For most targets there is only one exception table, usually accessed via
 *	globals generated by the linker, e.g. __exception_table_start__ and
 *	__exception_table_end__, so we just fill in those addresses and return TRUE.
 *
 *	If the target supports multiple fragments or overlays or for some other reason
 *	has more than one exception table index for a single program, we can use
 *	'retaddr' to find the appropriate index. If 'retaddr' doesn't correspond to
 *	any known exception table index then we must return FALSE.
